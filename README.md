# Online Binary Converter

A simple and interactive web application to convert decimal numbers to 8-bit binary and vice versa.

🚀 **Live Demo:** [https://binary-convertion.vercel.app/](https://binary-convertion.vercel.app/)

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Conversion**: Instantly converts decimal numbers to their 8-bit binary representation.
- **Interactive Bits**: Click on any bit to toggle it between 0 and 1, automatically updating the decimal value.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensures input is an integer.
  - Restricts input to the 0-255 range (8-bit limit).
  - Provides clear visual feedback for errors (e.g., empty input, out of range).
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and simple UI built with TailwindCSS.
